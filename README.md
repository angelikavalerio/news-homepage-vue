## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- Tailwind CSS
- SCSS
- [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

Learned how to configure Tailwind CSS, as well as, adding custom breakpoints and animations.

### Continued development

Need to work on improving setting of breakpoints in Tailwind and also figuring out an easy way to remove scrolling from the content behind whenever the navigation is open without relying on Javascript. 

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind CSS Documentation](https://v2.tailwindcss.com/docs) - Relied on this documentation to determine the associated class for a CSS property.
